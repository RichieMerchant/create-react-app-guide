## Setting up your local development environment

One of the most important steps before starting your development is setting up your local development environment. There are various ways to set up Node and NPM and if you have them already installed, you can skip this section. This is my prefered way of setting them up.

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
2. Install Node via Brew: `brew install node`
3. Install a Node version manager ([n](https://github.com/tj/n) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
4. Update to latest NPM: `npm install -g npm@latest`

To get started, follow the [docs](https://github.com/RichieMerchant/create-react-app-guide/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md)
